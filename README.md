# Dog Care and Wellness Website  

Welcome to our Dog Care and Wellness project repository! This website was developed during **webHorizon**, a two-day coding event where we embraced the challenge of creating a platform dedicated to dog care and wellness.  

## About the Project  
Our project aims to provide dog owners with tools and resources to track their pets' health and wellness. Despite being a first-time competition experience, we took the opportunity to learn, collaborate, and showcase our work beyond the event.  

## Features Developed  
- **Weight Tracker and BMI Calculator**: Tools to monitor and evaluate your dog's health metrics.  
- **Vaccination Scheduler**: A feature to plan and manage vaccination dates effectively.  
- **Dog Profiles**: Profiles built using JSON data for individual dogs, storing key details.  
- **Gallery**: A dedicated space to showcase photos of dogs.  
- **Veterinarian Information**: A section to find details about veterinarians for quick access.  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the website.  
- **CSS (Bootstrap)**: To enhance design and responsiveness.  
- **JavaScript (Basic)**: For interactive and dynamic functionalities.  
- **JSON**: To manage and store dog profile data.  
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform to make our project accessible online.  
- **GitHub**: For sharing the code and handling version control.
